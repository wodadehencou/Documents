As an application developer, to learn about how to install and use the Node.js SDK, please visit the SDK documentation. This project publishes two separate npm packages: fabric-client - main client for the Hyperledger Fabric. Applications can use this package to install and instantiate chaincodes, submit transactions and make queries against a Hyperledger Fabric-based blockchain network. fabric-ca-client - client for the optional component in Hyperledger Fabric, fabric-ca. The fabric-ca component allows applications to enroll Peers and application users to establish trusted identities on the blockchain network. It also provides support for pseudonymous transaction submissions with Transaction Certificates. If the target blockchain network is configured with standard Certificate Authorities for trust anchors, the application does not need to use this package. The following section targets a current or future contributor to this project itself. Build and TestTo build and test, the following pre-requisites must be installed first: node runtime version 6.9.x, note that 7.0 is not supported at this point npm tool version 3.10.x gulp command docker (not required if you only want to run the headless tests with npm test-headless, see below) Clone the project and launch the following commands to install the dependencies and perform various tasks. In the project root folder: npm install to install dependencies gulp ca to copy common dependent modules from the fabric-client folder to the fabric-ca-client folder and the installed fabric-ca-client package under node_modules gulp watch to set up watch that updates fabric-ca-client's shared dependencies from fabric-client/lib and updates installed fabric-client and fabric-ca-client modules in node_modules. This command does not return, so you should keep it running in a separate command window as you work on the code and test in another command window optionally, gulp doc to generate API docs if you want to review the doc content npm test-headless to run the headless tests that do not require any additional set up The following tests require setting up a local blockchain network as the target. Because v1.0 is still in active development, you still need to build the necessary Docker images needed to run the network. Follow the steps below to set it up. You will need the peers, orderers and fabric-ca server (new implementation of the member service) to run the tests. The first two components are from the fabric repository. The fabric-ca server is from the fabric-ca repository. git clone both the fabric and fabric-ca repositories into the $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger folder in your native host (MacOS, Windows or Ubuntu, etc). You can build the docker images in your native host (Mac, Ubuntu, Windows, etc.): If docker is installed and it’s not ‘Docker for Mac/Windows’, uninstall and follow Docker’s clean up instructions to uninstall completely. Install ‘Docker for Mac’ or Docker for Windows, or Docker on linux Only for Mac, you need to install a gnu-compatible version of the tar utility: Install Brew: http://brew.sh run brew install gnu-tar —-with-default-names in order to swap out Mac's default tar command for a gnu-compliant one needed by chaincode execution on the peers build fabric-ca docker image (new membership service) cd `$GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca run make docker. For more build instructions see fabric-ca README build fabric peer and orderer docker images and other ancillary images cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric run make docker to build the docker images (you may need to run make docker-clean first if you've built before) go to fabric-sdk-node/test/fixtures run docker-compose up --force-recreate to launch the network Now you are ready to run the tests: Clear out your previous key value stores that may have cached user enrollment certificates (rm -rf /tmp/hfc-*, rm -rf ~/.hfc-key-store) run 'gulp test' to execute the entire test suite (495+ test cases), or you can run them individually Test user management by member services with the following tests that exercise the fabric-ca-client package with a KeyValueStore implementations for a file-based KeyValueStore as well as a CouchDB KeyValueStore. To successfully run this test, you must first set up a CouchDB database instance on your local machine. Please see the instructions below. test/integration/fabric-ca-services-tests.js test/integration/couchdb-fabricca-tests.js test/integration/cloudant-fabricca-tests.js Test happy path from end to end, run node test/integration/e2e.js Test end to end one step at a time, make sure to follow this sequence: node test/integration/e2e/create-channel.js node test/integration/e2e/join-channel.js node test/integration/e2e/install-chaincode.js node test/integration/e2e/instantiate-chaincode.js node test/integration/e2e/invoke-transaction.js node test/integration/e2e/query.js Set Up CouchDB Database for couchdb-fabricca-tests.jsThe KeyValueStore database implementation is done using Apache CouchDB. To quickly set up a database instance on your local machine, pull in the CouchDB Docker image from Docker hub. docker pull couchdbStart up the database instance and expose the default port 5984 on the host. docker run -d -p 5984:5984 --name my-couchdb couchdbEnsure that the Docker container running CouchDB is up. docker psYou will see output similar to the one below: CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 33caf5a80fca couchdb &quot;tini -- /docker-entr&quot; 47 hours ago Up 47 hours 0.0.0.0:5984-&gt;5984/tcp my-couchdbEnsure that CouchDB instance is up and ready for requests. curl DOCKER_HOST_IP:5984/For example, the default DOCKER_HOST_IP on Mac is 192.168.99.100 or `localhost', therefore the request becomes: curl 192.168.99.100:5984/ or curl localhost:5984/If the database is up and running, you will receive the following response: { &quot;couchdb&quot;: &quot;Welcome&quot;, &quot;uuid&quot;: &quot;01b6d4481b7ff9e6e067d90c6d20aa83&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.6.1&quot;, &quot;vendor&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;The Apache Software Foundation&quot;, &quot;version&quot;:&quot;1.6.1&quot; } }Configurable settings are encapsulated in test/fixtures/couchdb.json and can be overridden with environment variables or command parameters. Run the associated unit test with the following command: node test/unit/couchdb-fabricca-tests.jsContributor Check-listThe following check-list is for code contributors to make sure their changesets are compliant to the coding standards and avoid time wasted in rejected changesets: Check the coding styles, run the following command and make sure no ESLint violations are present: gulp Run the full unit test bucket and make sure 100% are passing. Because v1.0 is still in active development, all tests may not pass. You can run each individually to isolate the failure(s): gulp test The gulp test command above also generates code coverage reports. Your new code should be accompanied with unit tests and provide 80% line coverage or higher. HFC objects and reference documentationFor a high-level design specificiation for Fabric SDKs of all languages, visit this google doc (Work-In-Progress). fabric-client and fabric-ca-client are written in CommonJS modules and take advantage of ECMAScript 2015 class syntax. The main top-level class is Chain. It is the client's view of a fabric channel. The SDK allows you to interact with multiple channels. A chain object can be configured with a different ordering service or share a common ordering service, depending on how the target blockchain network is set up. A chain object has a KeyValueStore to store private keys and certificates for authenticated users. Through the chain object the application can perform The KeyValueStore is a very simple interface which SDK uses to store and retrieve all persistent data. This data includes private keys, so it is very important to keep this storage secure. The default implementation is a simple file-based version found in the FileKeyValueStore class. The SDK also provides an implementation based on CouchDB which can be configured to use a local CouchDB database or a remote deployment including a Cloudant database. The User class represents an end user who transacts on the chain. The user object must have a valid enrollment configured in order to properly sign transaction requests. The enrollment materials can either be obtained from enrolling with fabric-ca or an external Certificate Authority. The EventHub class encapsulates the interaction with the network peers' event streams. The FabricCAClientImpl class provides security and identity related features such as user registration and enrollment, transaction certificate issuance. The Hyperledger Fabric has a built-in implementation that issues ECerts (enrollment certificates) and TCerts (transaction certificates). ECerts are for enrollment identity and TCerts are for transactions. PluggabilityHFC defines the following abstract classes for application developers to supply extensions or alternative implementations. For each abstract class, a built-in implementation is included with the ability to load alternative implementations via designated environment variables: To replace FileKeyValueStore with a different implementation, such as one that saves data to a database, specify &quot;KEY_VALUE_STORE&quot; and provide the full require() path to an alternative implementation of the api.KeyValueStore abstract class. The cryptography suite used by the default implementation uses ECDSA for asymmetric keys cryptography, AES for encryption and SHA2/3 for secure hashes. A different suite can be plugged in with &quot;CRYPTO_SUITE&quot; environment variable specifying full require() path to the alternative implementation of the api.CrytoSuite abstract class. If the user application uses an alternative membership service than the one provided by the component fabric-ca, the client code will likely need to use an alternative client to fabric-ca-client to interact with that membership service. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.3 on April 24th 2017, 5:04:02 pm using the DocStrap template.

The “Chain” object captures settings for a channel, which is created by the orderers to isolate transactions delivery to peers participating on channel. A chain must be initialized after it has been configured with the list of peers and orderers. The initialization sends a get configuration block request to the primary orderer to retrieve the configuration settings for this channel. new Chain(name, clientContext) Parameters: Name Type Description name string to identify different chain instances. The naming of chain instances is enforced by the ordering service and must be unique within the blockchain network clientContext Client An instance of Client that provides operational context such as submitting User etc. Methods addOrderer(orderer) Add orderer endpoint to a chain object, this is a local-only operation. A chain instance may choose to use a single orderer node, which will broadcast requests to the rest of the orderer network.

A client instance provides a handler to interact with a network of peers, orderers and optionally member services. An application using the SDK may need to interact with multiple networks, each through a separate instance of the Client. Each client when initially created should be initialized with configuration data from the consensus service, which includes a list of trusted roots, orderer certificates and IP addresses, and a list of peer certificates and IP addresses that it can access. This must be done out of band as part of bootstrapping the application environment. It is also the responsibility of the application to maintain the configuration of a client as the SDK does not persist this object. Each Client instance can maintain several Chain instances representing channels and the associated private ledgers. new Client() Methods &lt;static&gt; addConfigFile(path) Adds a file to the top of the list of configuration setting files that are part of the hierarchical configuration. These files will override the default settings and be overriden by environment, command line arguments, and settings programmatically set into configuration settings. hierarchy search order: memory - all settings added with sdkUtils.setConfigSetting(name,value) Command-line arguments Environment variables (names will be change from AAA-BBB to aaa-bbb) Custom Files - all files added with the addConfigFile(path) will be ordered by when added, were last one added will override previously added files The file located at 'config/default.json' with default settings Parameters: Name Type Description path String The path to the file to be added to the top of list of configuration files &lt;static&gt; getConfigSetting(name, default_value) Retrieves a setting from the hierarchical configuration and if not found will return the provided default value. hierarchy search order: memory - settings added with sdkUtils.setConfigSetting(name,value) Command-line arguments Environment variables (names will be change from AAA-BBB to aaa-bbb) Custom Files - all files added with the addConfigFile(path) will be ordered by when added, were last one added will override previously added files The file located at 'config/default.json' with default settings Parameters: Name Type Description name String The name of a setting default_value Object The value of a setting if not found in the hierarchical configuration &lt;static&gt; newDefaultKeyValueStore(options) Obtains an instance of the KeyValueStore class. By default it returns the built-in implementation, which is based on files (FileKeyValueStore). This can be overriden with an environment variable KEY_VALUE_STORE, the value of which is the full path of a CommonJS module for the alternative implementation. Parameters: Name Type Description options Object is whatever the implementation requires for initializing the instance. For the built-in file-based implementation, this requires a single property &quot;path&quot; to the top-level folder for the store Returns: KeyValueStore an instance of the KeyValueStore implementation &lt;static&gt; setConfigSetting(name, value) Adds a setting to override all settings that are part of the hierarchical configuration. hierarchy search order: memory - settings added with this call Command-line arguments Environment variables (names will be change from AAA-BBB to aaa-bbb) Custom Files - all files added with the addConfigFile(path) will be ordered by when added, were last one added will override previously added files The file located at 'config/default.json' with default settings Parameters: Name Type Description name String The name of a setting value Object The value of a setting &lt;static&gt; setLogger(logger) Configures a logger for the entire HFC SDK to use and override the default logger. Unless this method is called, HFC uses a default logger (based on winston). When using the built-in &quot;winston&quot; based logger, use the environment variable HFC_LOGGING to pass in configurations in the following format: { 'error': 'error.log', // 'error' logs are printed to file 'error.log' relative of the current working dir for node.js 'debug': '/tmp/myapp/debug.log', // 'debug' and anything more critical ('info', 'warn', 'error') can also be an absolute path 'info': 'console' // 'console' is a keyword for logging to console } Parameters: Name Type Description logger Object a logger instance that defines the following methods: debug(), info(), warn(), error() with string interpolation methods like util.format. getChain(name) Get a Chain instance from the state storage. This allows existing chain instances to be saved for retrieval later and to be shared among instances of the application. Note that it’s the application/SDK’s responsibility to record the chain information. If an application is not able to look up the chain information from storage, it may call another API that queries one or more Peers for that information. Parameters: Name Type Description name string The name of the chain. Throws: if the state store has not been set or a chain does not exist under that name. Type Error Returns: The chain instance Type Chain getStateStore() A convenience method for obtaining the state store object in use for this client. Returns: The KeyValueStore implementation object set within this Client, or null if it does not exist. Type KeyValueStore getUserContext(name) As explained above, the client instance can have an optional state store. The SDK saves enrolled users in the storage which can be accessed by authorized users of the application (authentication is done by the application outside of the SDK). This function attempts to load the user by name from the local storage (via the KeyValueStore interface). The loaded user object must represent an enrolled user with a valid enrollment certificate signed by a trusted CA (such as the CA server). Parameters: Name Type Description name String Optional. If not specified, will only return the in-memory user context object, or null if not found in memory. If &quot;name&quot; is specified, will also attempt to load it from the state store if search in memory failed. Returns: The user object corresponding to the name, or null if the user does not exist or if the state store has not been set. Type Promise loadUserFromStateStore() Restore the state of this member from the key value store (if found). If not found, do nothing. Returns: A Promise for a {User} object upon successful restore, or if the user by the name does not exist in the state store, returns null without rejecting the promise Type Promise newChain(name) Returns a chain instance with the given name. This represents a channel and its associated ledger (as explained above), and this call returns an empty object. To initialize the chain in the blockchain network, a list of participating endorsers and orderer peers must be configured first on the returned object. Parameters: Name Type Description name string The name of the chain. Recommend using namespaces to avoid collision. Throws: if the chain by that name already exists in the application's state store Type Error Returns: The uninitialized chain instance. Type Chain queryChainInfo(name, peers) This is a network call to the designated Peer(s) to discover the chain information. The target Peer(s) must be part of the chain to be able to return the requested information. Parameters: Name Type Description name string The name of the chain. peers Array.&lt;Peer&gt; Array of target Peers to query. Returns: The chain instance for the name or error if the target Peer(s) does not know anything about the chain. Type Chain saveUserToStateStore() Save the state of this member to the key value store. Returns: A Promise for the user context object upon successful save Type Promise setStateStore(keyValueStore) The enrollment materials for Users that have appeared in the instances of the application. The SDK should have a built-in key value store file-based implementation to allow easy setup during development. Production systems would use a store backed by database for more robust storage and clustering, so that multiple app instances can share app state via the database. This API makes this pluggable so that different store implementations can be selected by the application. Parameters: Name Type Description keyValueStore KeyValueStore Instance of an alternative KeyValueStore implementation provided by the consuming app. setUserContext(user, skipPersistence) Sets an instance of the User class as the security context of self client instance. This user’s credentials (ECert), or special transaction certificates that are derived from the user's ECert, will be used to conduct transactions and queries with the blockchain network. Upon setting the user context, the SDK saves the object in a persistence cache if the “state store” has been set on the Client instance. If no state store has been set, this cache will not be established and the application is responsible for setting the user context again if the application crashes and is recovered. Parameters: Name Type Description user User An instance of the User class encapsulating the authenticated user’s signing materials (private key and enrollment certificate) skipPersistence boolean Whether to skip saving the user object into persistence.

The Peer class represents the remote Peer node and its network membership materials, aka the ECert used to verify signatures. Peer membership represents organizations, unlike User membership which represents individuals. When constructed, a Peer instance can be designated as an event source, in which case a “eventSourceUrl” attribute should be configured. This allows the SDK to automatically attach transaction event listeners to the event stream. It should be noted that Peer event streams function at the Peer level and not at the chain and chaincode levels. new Peer(url, opts) Constructs a Peer given its endpoint configuration settings. Parameters: Name Type Description url string The URL with format of &quot;grpcs://host:port&quot;. opts Object The options for the connection to the peer. Methods addListener(eventType, eventTypeData, eventCallback) For a Peer that is connected to eventSource, the addListener registers an EventCallBack for a set of event types. addListener can be invoked multiple times to support differing EventCallBack functions receiving different types of events. Note that the parameters below are optional in certain languages, like Java, that constructs an instance of a listener interface, and pass in that instance as the parameter. Parameters: Name Type Description eventType string : ie. Block, Chaincode, Transaction eventTypeData object : Object Specific for event type as necessary, currently needed for “Chaincode” event type, specifying a matching pattern to the event name set in the chaincode(s) being executed on the target Peer, and for “Transaction” event type, specifying the transaction ID eventCallback class Client Application class registering for the callback. Returns: An ID reference to the event listener. Type string connectEventSource() Since practically all Peers are event producers, when constructing a Peer instance, an application can designate it as the event source for the application. Typically only one of the Peers on a Chain needs to be the event source, because all Peers on the Chain produce the same events. This method tells the SDK which Peer(s) to use as the event source for the client application. It is the responsibility of the SDK to manage the connection lifecycle to the Peer’s EventHub. It is the responsibility of the Client Application to understand and inform the selected Peer as to which event types it wants to receive and the call back functions to use.

Returns: The name of the Peer Type string getRoles() Get the user’s roles the Peer participates in. It’s an array of possible values in “client”, and “auditor”.

Type Array.&lt;string&gt; isEventListened(eventName, chain) A network call that discovers if at least one listener has been connected to the target Peer for a given event. This helps application instance to decide whether it needs to connect to the event source in a crash recovery or multiple instance instantiation.
