<FONT size=+1>Digital signal multiplier </FONT><BR><BR>
<CENTER><B>Abstract</B></CENTER>
<P>An electronic circuit that multiplies an input signal using primarily digital 
components so that the resulting circuit can be fabricated consistently by 
different foundries. The circuit determines a period for the input signal and 
converts the period to a digital number (e.g., a binary number). An adder is 
used to determine an average period over a predetermined number of cycles. By 
determining the average period, voltage fluctuations are cancelled. A multiplier 
allows for a variable multiplication of the averaged period. A clock generating 
circuit uses the results obtained by the multiplier to generate a multiplied 
output signal. Additionally, the input signal is routinely multiplexed with the 
generated output signal to ensure phase matching. </P>

<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION <BR><BR>This invention relates generally to input 
signals (e.g., clock signals) in integrated circuits, and, more particularly, 
relates to multiplying and/or reshaping such input signals. <BR><BR>BACKGROUND 
OF THE INVENTION <BR><BR>In many digital systems, such as those including 
microprocessors and digital signal processors, the incoming clock needs to be 
reshaped and/or multiplied. Multiplication is typically accomplished using a 
phase lock loop (PLL) circuit. PLL circuits lock a generated signal to a 
reference signal using a feedback control system that brings the two signals 
into a fixed phase relation. Traditional PLL circuits contain analog components, 
such as voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs). Manufacturing integrated circuits 
with analog components results in non-uniform and error-prone products. For 
example, a design produced by multiple foundries can have different electrical 
characteristics because of slight variations in the fabrication process. 
Additionally, analog components must be calibrated, which adds cost and may 
introduce error. <BR><BR>To overcome the problems of analog components, digital 
PLL circuits were developed. Known digital PLL circuits require a high frequency 
input reference signal that allows small clock phase adjustments to be made to a 
generated output signal. Typically, phase correction is accomplished by a 
feedback loop wherein the output signal is fed back into a phase comparator for 
comparison with the input clock. To use such digital PLL circuits, the high 
frequency input reference signal is typically a much higher frequency than the 
generated output signal. For example, the reference signal may be twice the 
frequency of the output signal. <BR><BR>The generated output signal may be used 
to drive a microprocessor or other integrated circuits. However, recent 
microprocessors require high frequency clocks. For example, with existing 
technology, the PLL circuit needs to generate an output signal of nearly 500 
MHz. And within a relatively short period of time, for example 3 years or so, 
microprocessors are expected to run with a 1 GHz clock signal. In order for 
current PLL circuits to generate a 500 MHz clock, a 1 GHz input reference signal 
is needed. However, such high-frequency clocks are expensive and difficult to 
manufacture. Consequently, as microprocessor speeds increase, generating an 
input reference signal running at a sufficient frequency is becoming increasing 
problematic. <BR><BR>The output signal may also need to be reshaped. Reshaping 
may be necessary to obtain a clock signal with a 50/50 duty cycle--a clock 
signal that has symmetrical high and low states. A 50/50 duty cycle may be 
obtained by dividing an input clock in half, since the period of the clock 
signal is assumed constant. However, as already described, dividing a clock 
signal in half before feeding it to a microprocessor has significant drawbacks, 
since there are practical limitations on the frequency of the source clock. 
<BR><BR>Another option for reshaping a clock signal is shown in Bechade, U.S. 
Pat. No. 5,179,294. The reshaping circuit of Bechade and other digital PLL 
circuits use delay elements to determine a period of the incoming clock signal. 
The delay elements are subject to voltage and temperature fluctuations, which 
can vary the length of the delay. Such variations in the delay elements cause an 
inconsistent duty cycle in the generated output signal, which effects the 
performance of the overall circuit. <BR><BR>SUMMARY OF INVENTION <BR><BR>In one 
embodiment, a multiplier circuit is disclosed that multiplies and/or reshapes an 
input signal. The multiplier circuit in this embodiment is primarily digital so 
that an integrated circuit produced by one foundry will have similar electrical 
characteristics as the same circuit produced by another foundry. Additionally, 
the multiplier circuit does not require a high frequency reference clock, making 
it more practical and economical as microprocessor speeds increase. <BR><BR>In 
one aspect of the illustrated embodiment, a period determining circuit is used 
to determine the period of an input signal and to convert the period to a 
digital number, such as a binary number. The period determining circuit may 
include a delay circuit, a comparator, and an edge detector to continuously or 
repetitively determine the period of the input signal. A count leading edge may 
then be used to convert the period into a binary number. <BR><BR>In another 
aspect of the illustrated embodiment, an adder may be used in conjunction with a 
multiplier/divider to calculate the average of the period over a predetermined 
number of cycles. Thus, by calculating an average period, imperfections in the 
delay circuit due to voltage fluctuations are in effect cancelled. <BR><BR>In 
yet another aspect of the illustrated embodiment, a variable multiplication 
control is applied to the multiplier/divider to multiply the averaged signal. 
The multiplier/divider may be a shifter circuit and the multiplication control 
may in this case control the direction and the number of bits that are shifted. 
The shifter may take into account both the division needed for calculating the 
average period and the multiplication simultaneously. The shifter may be set to 
shift the accumulated number calculated by the adder. <BR><BR>In yet a further 
aspect of the illustrated embodiment, a variable delay line is coupled to the 
multiplier/divider to generate the multiplied or reshaped output signal. A 
multiplexer may be used to synchronize the variable delay and the original input 
signal so that phase matching is constantly monitored and maintained. 
<BR><BR>These advantages and other advantages and features of the inventions 
will become apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds 
with reference to the following drawings. The present invention relates to the 
novel and non-obvious aspects of the invention individually as well as 
collectively. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS <BR><BR>FIG. 1 is block

EMBODIMENT <BR><BR>FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a multiplier circuit 10 
according to one embodiment of the invention. An input periodic signal to be 
multiplied (in this case a clock signal) is supplied to a period determining 
circuit 12. The input signal is an alternating signal having a fixed or varying 
period. Although the input signal is typically described below as a clock 
signal, the input signal may be any desired alternating signal. The period 
determining circuit 12 continuously or repetitively determines the period of the 
input clock signal and converts the period to a digital number or format (e.g., 
a binary number, hexadecimal number, etc.). For illustrative purposes the 
digital format will be described as a binary number. An adding circuit 14 
receives the binary number representing a period for the current cycle from the 
period determining circuit 12. The adding circuit 14 adds the binary number over 
successive periods for a number of cycles, typically a predetermined number of 
cycles (between 8 and 256 cycles). The number of cycles may alternatively be 
adjusted dynamically. After the desired number of cycles is reached, an 
averaging and multiplication circuit 16 effectively divides the total obtained 
by the adding circuit 14 by the number of cycles. Thus, the averaging and 
multiplication circuit 16 determines an average period over a number of cycles 
so that variations in the input signal or discrepancies due to voltage 
fluctuations are effectively cancelled or minimized. The averaging and 
multiplication circuit 16 then multiplies the average period by a desired number 
to obtain a multiplication factor. As described more fully below, the dividing 
and multiplication may be accomplished in separate steps and by separate 
circuits, or may be accomplished simultaneously by only one circuit, such as a 
shifter or a divider. An output signal generating circuit 18 uses the 
multiplication factor to generate an output signal that is a multiple of the 
input signal. The circuit can also be used to only reshape the input signal. In 
such a case, the averaging and multiplication circuitry determines the average 
period and effectively multiplies by a multiplication factor of 1. As is 
described more fully below, the output signal generating circuitry 18 may also 
use the input signal to phase match the input and output signals. <BR><BR>FIGS. 
2 and 3 show a more detailed circuit diagram of an exemplary embodiment of the 
multiplier circuit 10. An illustrated form of the period determining circuitry 
and adding circuitry are shown by dashed boxes 12, 14, respectively, in FIG. 2. 
Also, one form of the averaging and multiplying circuitry 16 and output signal 
generating circuitry 18 are shown in FIG. 3. Turning first to FIG. 2, the input 
signal is applied to an input signal node 20, wherein the illustrated input 
signal is an external clock signal to be multiplied or reshaped. A buffer 22 is 
coupled to the input signal node 20 and drives the clock signal to the internal 
circuits within the multiplier 10. The buffered clock signal in this specific 
embodiment is applied to a delay circuit 24 that includes a first set of delays 
26 and a second set of delays 28. A differential delay element 30 is coupled in 
series with the second set of delays 28. The differential delay element 30 and 
second set of delays 28 are used to increase the granularity of the circuit 10 
by ensuring that the clock signal passing through the second set of delays 28 
lags by half a delay stage behind the first set of delays 26. A variety of 
different electrical components can be used for the differential delay 30. For 
example, the differential delay may be a transfer gate or a buffer. Other 
possible differential delays are well-known in the art and can be used as well. 
In the case where the differential delay is a buffer, it should be sized 
differently than buffers used in the first and second sets of delays. In any 
event, the first and second sets of delays 26, 28 in this embodiment include 
multiple stages of delay elements coupled in series. A more specific example of 
the first and second sets of delays are described more fully below in relation 
to FIG. 6. <BR><BR>A comparator 32 (FIG. 2) is used to compare an output from 
each delay stage from the first and second sets of delays 26, 28. The 
illustrated comparator 32 includes multiple comparator stages, one of which is 
shown in FIG. 4 and described more fully below. The illustrated comparator 32 
has multiple outputs that can be used to determine the number of delay stages 
needed to delay the input clock signal by one full cycle. An edge detector 34 
and a count leading edge 36 form a binary converter that converts the output of 
the comparator 32 to a binary number. The binary number represents the number of 
delay stages needed to delay the input clock by one full cycle. There are a 
variety of ways to determine a period as is well known in the art and other 
period determining circuits may be used. For example, the edge detector 34 and 
count leading edge 36 may be eliminated and replaced with alternative circuits 
for creating a binary number. Additionally, alternative circuits for the delay 
24 and comparator 32 may be used. <BR><BR>The adding circuit 14 receives the 
output of the period determining circuit 12. The adding circuit 14 sums the 
binary number provided by the binary converter over a number of cycles. The 
number of cycles may be predetermined or change dynamically and may vary based 
on the application. Virtually any number of cycles may be used. For example, the 
cycles can be a number between 8 and 256. The illustrated adding circuit 
includes an adder 38, a counter 40, a multiplexer 42, a pulse generator 44, and 
two registers 46, 48. The illustrated counter 40 may be preset with a 
predetermined number of cycles and when the counter exceeds that number, it 
switches the multiplexer 42 to an input labeled as input 0. Input 0 on the 
multiplexer 42 has a constant low voltage level applied thereto. The adder 
therefore adds a binary 0 from input 0 and a binary number received from the 
period determining circuit 12. This addition represents the first cycle in the 
predetermined number of cycles which the binary number is continually added. On 
the next cycle, the counter 40 switches the multiplexer 42 to an input labeled 
input 1, which adds register 46 (an accumulated sum) and the binary number from 
the period determining circuit 12. The pulse generator 44 creates a pulse in 
response to the input signal on the input signal node 20. The pulse generator 
can take a wide variety of forms, such as a NAND gate and inverter combination, 
as is shown in Bechade et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,179,294, which is hereby 
incorporated by reference. In this example, with each cycle, the pulse generator 
44 causes the output of the adder 38 to be loaded into register 46 to accumulate 
the successive summations of the binary numbers from the period determining 
circuit 12. The data stored in register 46 is fed back through the multiplexer 
42 to be added to the next binary number passed by the period determining 
circuit 12. When counter 40 exceeds the predetermined number, it not only resets 
the adder 38 as described above, but also loads register 48 with the total 
summation of binary numbers accumulated over the predetermined number of cycles. 
Thus, the register 48 contains a summation of binary numbers representing 
successive periods added over a number of cycles. This summation can now be used 
to determine the average period. One skilled in the art will recognize that 
there are a variety of ways to implement the adding circuit 14. For example, 
some adding circuits do not include a pulse generator, counter, or multiplexer. 
Other adding circuits may readily be used instead of the specific form of adding 
circuit 14 shown in FIG. 2. <BR><BR>FIG. 3 shows the remainder of the 
illustrated multiplier circuit 10. The averaging and multiplication circuit 16 
(also called the multiplier) is a shifter in this example that performs 
multiplication or division based on the direction of shifting. The shifter 
receives the summation from register 48 (FIG. 2). The number of bits the shifter 
is shifted depends on a variable multiplication control 50 and the number of 
cycles that are added in the adding circuit 14. To obtain an average period, the 
shifter is shifted so as to divide the number received from register 48 by the 
number of cycles. For example, if the binary number from the period determining 
circuit 12 is added in the adder over 32 cycles, the shifter is shifted by six 
bits to account for dividing by 32. This results in a binary number representing 
the average period of the input clock signal. Additional shifting is performed 
to obtain a multiplication factor for the average period. The number of bits the 
shifter is shifted is controlled by the variable multiplication control input 
50, which may be a register that is loaded with the desired shifting data. 
Alternatively, the multiplication control 50 may be hard-wired. Although, the 
division to obtain the average period and the multiplication are performed at 
the same time by a single shifter, the division and multiplication can be split 
amongst different electrical components so that an average period is calculated 
separately from the multiplication. Typical multiplications include a 
multiplication by 2, 4 or 8, but virtually any multiplication factor can be 
used. For example, a multiplication by 1 causes the generated output signal to 
be the same frequency as the input signal, but reshaped to have a uniform duty 
cycle. Although the circuit 16 is called a multiplier herein, it is understood 
that the multiplier is so named because it is determining a multiplication 
factor. In actuality, the multiplier may be shifting so as to divide rather than 
multiply. Consequently, a divider may be used instead. Alternatively, the 
circuit 16 may perform a true multiplication. Additionally, although the 
multiplier is shown as a shift register, other techniques for multiplication may 
be used as are well known in the art. <BR><BR>The output signal generating 
circuit 18 uses the multiplication factor determined in the averaging and 
multiplication circuit 16. In the illustrated example, the signal generating 
circuit 18 includes a digital-to-analog converter 52 (DAC), a multiplexer 54, a 
variable delay line 56, a voltage control delay 58, a counter 60, and an output 
buffer 62. As explained further below, many of these components can be 
eliminated based on the application or an entirely different signal generating 
circuit may be used instead. Most of the bits from the shifter go to the 
variable delay line 56. However, the two lowest bits of the shifter, or the 
least significant bits, go to DAC 52. The DAC converts the two lowest bits to 
analog to control the voltage control delay 58. The voltage control delay 
fine-tunes the amount of delay to provide greater accuracy. The variable delay 
line 56 and the voltage controlled delay 58 together delay the generated clock 
signal by an amount directly related to the output of the shifter. This delay 
determines the frequency of the output clock signal. If less accuracy is needed, 
the DAC 52 and voltage controlled delay 58 can be eliminated. Alternatively, if 
greater accuracy is desired, additional bits from the shifter can be passed to 
the DAC 52 and voltage controlled delay 58. The multiplexer 54 switches between 
the output of the voltage control delay 58 and the input clock signal based on 
the counter 60. In this embodiment, once per cycle, the counter 60 allows the 
input clock signal to pass to the variable delay line 56 so as to synchronize 
the generated output signal to the input signal, ensuring that they are phase 
matched. The output buffer 62 provides sufficient power so that the generated 
clock signal can be used by other circuits within the system without signal 
degradation. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the output signal 
generating circuit is a form of a ring oscillator. The number of cycles that the 
binary number is accumulated over provides additional accuracy by averaging out 
jitter and power supply noises. For example, if the multiplication circuit 
multiplies the frequency by 4 and sums the binary count over 32 cycles, the 
binary count has an additional 4 bits of data below the decimal point. These 
bits can be used to fine tune the delay in the ring oscillator by converting 
these bits to analog and applying the bits to a voltage controlled delay 58. 
Alternatively, the bits can be used to control a network of load capacitors 
instead of or in addition to the voltage control delay. Although a specific 
output signal generating circuit is shown, alternative output signal generating 
circuits may be used. For example, the counter 60 and multiplexer 54 can be 
eliminated if phase matching is not desired. <BR><BR>FIG. 6 shows an example of 
the first and second set of delays 26, 28 in detail. The delays 26, 28 include 
multiple delay stages 64 coupled in series. The delay stages 64 comprise two 
serially coupled inverters, such as inverters 66 and 68, that delay the input 
signal by the propagation delay of the inverters. The number of delay stages is 
shown generically by having the last stage labeled as "delay N" in the first set 
of delays 26 and "delay N+1" in the second set of delays 28. Also, delays 26, 28 
in the illustrated form have multiple outputs, one for each stage. The outputs 
are labeled corresponding to the amount of delay. For example, the output delay1 
is the shortest delay within both sets of delays 26, 28. The output labeled 
delay2 lags behind delay1 by the amount of delay caused by differential delay 
30. DelayN+1 represents the input signal after it passes through all other delay 
stages in the second set of delays 28. Those skilled in the art will recognize 
that alternative delay circuitry may also be used. In general, lowering the 
delay within the delay stages 24 and increasing the number of delay stages 
improves the resolution of the waveform output from the multiplier circuit 10. 
<BR><BR>FIG. 4 shows one exemplary comparator stage 70 of the illustrated 
comparator 32. In this form of comparator, there is one comparator stage per 
output of the first and second set of delays 26, 28. The comparator stage 70 
compares one of the delay stage outputs to the input clock signal after it 
passes through buffer 22 (FIG. 1). The stage 70, in the form shown, includes 
complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits in a pullup/pulldown 
relationship. P-channel field-effect transistors (PFETs) 72, 73, which are 
indicated by a rectangle with a diagonal line therein, form the pullup portion 
of the stage. N-channel field-effect transistors (NFETs) 74, 75 form the 
pulldown portion of the stage. When the input signal is at a high-voltage level, 
both the NFET 75 and the PFET 72 are turned on since the input signal (shown as 
a clock signal) is applied to the NFET 75 and its inverted sense is applied to 
PFET 72. Thus, the voltage level of the delay stage controls whether a node 76 
is pulled up or down. If the delay stage output is a low-voltage level, PFET 73 
is turned on, and NFET 74 is turned off, creating a path between node 76 and 
Vdd. Consequently, the node 76 is charged to a high-voltage level. If the delay 
stage output is a high-voltage level, NFET 74 is turned on and PFET 73 is turned 
off. Thus, node 76 is pulled to a low-voltage level. When the input clock signal 
transitions to a low-voltage level, which is inverted and applied to an NFET 78, 
the NFET 78 turns on to latch the voltage level stored on node 76 by virtue of a 
feedback loop. When the input clock signal transitions to a high-voltage level, 
it is applied to the gate of the NFET 80, which passes the stored voltage level 
to an output latch 82. There are many techniques known in the art for comparing 
and latching data. The particular comparator and latch used are not of 
importance. The output of all of the comparator stages within comparator 32 
forms a string of 0's followed by a string of 1 s, followed by a string of 0's, 
etc. The strings mimic the input clock signal in increments of a fraction of a 
nanosecond, as defined by the delay in the delay circuit 26. <BR><BR>FIG. 8 
shows one stage of an exemplary edge detector 34. The illustrated edge detector 
34 includes an EXCLUSIVE OR gate 84 having inputs coupled to comparator stage I 
and I+1 (where I represents a stage). The results of the EXCLUSIVE OR are ANDED 
in AND gate 86 with the inverse of comparator stage I. Looking at all of the 
stages of the edge detector should yield a result where all of the outputs of 
the edge detector are a logic low except one, which represents a rising edge of 
the input clock signal. Other types of edge detectors may be used. Whether a 
rising or falling edge of the clock is detected is not important as either may 
be used. The output of the edge detector 34 is fed into the count leading edge 
36 (FIG. 2). The count leading edge converts the output of the edge detector 34 
to a binary number. Numerous count leading edges can be used, as is well known 
in the art. For example, the count leading edge may be a priority encoder, a 
count-leading zero, or a count leading one. For an example of a count leading 
zero, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,568,410, to Bechade, which is hereby incorporated by 
reference. <BR><BR>FIG. 5 shows further details of one form of an exemplary 
variable delay line 56. Three stages, 90, 92 and 94, are shown for the variable 
delay line, but additional stages are typically used. Turning first to stage 90, 
the output of bit 2 from the shifter 16 (i.e., labeled as S2) is applied to the 
NFETs 96 and the inverse of S2 is applied to NFET 98. Standard buffering is 
accomplished by buffers 100 between stages, and also on both inputs to the input 
stage 90. Stage 90 includes a two-inverter delay 102. The input to the variable 
delay line 56 corresponds to the generated output clock before passing through 
buffer 62 (see FIG. 2). If the shifter bit S2 is a high logic level, the 
two-inverter delay 102 is used to delay the generated clock signal. 
Alternatively, if the shifter bit S2 is a logic low, the transistor 98 is 
activated and transistors 96 are deactivated so that the stage 90 does not add 
to the delay, since the two-inverter delay 102 is bypassed. <BR><BR>Stage 92 is 
substantially similar to stage 90, except the delay is twice as long as the 
delay stage 90 because of the four inverters 104 between the transistors 106. 
Also, the third shifter bit S3 is coupled to transistors 106 while the inverse 
of S3 is applied to the transistor 107. <BR><BR>Stage 94 has a similar 
configuration, with eight inverters 110 situated between transistors 112. When 
S4 is activated at a logic high, the transistors 112 cause the clock signal to 
be delayed by the inverters 110. When S4 is not activated at a logic low, the 
transistor 114 is on, thereby causing the stage 94 to provide no additional 
delay since the inverters 110 are by passed. Thus, the output of the shifter 16 
controls the variable delay line 56 to determine the amount that the generated 
output signal from buffer 62 (FIG. 3) is delayed. Additionally, the voltage 
control delay 58 causes additional delay as determined by shifter bits S1 and 
S0, as is well understood in the art. Although a specific variable delay 56 is 
shown as using inverters, those skilled in the art will recognize that 
alternative variable delays may be used. <BR><BR>FIG. 7 shows a timing diagram 
116 that includes the input clock signal on node 20 (FIG. 2), the generated 
output clock signal 124 supplied from buffer 62 (FIG. 3), and the multiplexer 
control signal generated by the counter 60 (FIG. 3). The counter 60 generates a 
pulse 118 just prior to the leading edge 120 of the input clock signal. The 
short pulse 118 allows the input clock signal to pass through the multiplexer to 
node 119 (see FIG. 3). This allows the input clock to resynchronize the 
generated clock every cycle. The resynchronization could occur every cycle or 
less frequently depending on the application. On the falling edge of the pulse 
118, the multiplexer switches to the output of the voltage control delay 58, 
forcing the generated clock to a low voltage level on the edge 122. However, in 
this embodiment, the pulse 124 travels through the variable delay line 56 and 
the voltage control delay 58 and feeds back through multiplexer 54 back into the 
variable delay line 56, and so on. Consequently, a multiplied clock signal is 
generated at node 119 and is synchronized every period of the input clock signal 
so that phase matching is achieved. <BR><BR>Having illustrated and described the 
principles of the invention in a preferred embodiment, it should be apparent to 
those skilled in the art that the embodiments can be modified in arrangement and 
detail without departing from such principles. <BR><BR>For example, although the 
multiplier circuit is described as including a multiplexer for synchronizing the 
input signal and the output signal, this aspect of the invention need not be 
included if phase matching is not desired. <BR><BR>Additionally, although the 
multiplier is shown as a shifter, other multiplier and or divider circuits may 
be used. <BR><BR>Additionally, although the illustrated embodiments are shown 
primarily performed in hardware, one or more components may be performed in 
software. <BR><BR>Still further, the circuit may be used with any desired 
voltage levels representing a logic high and a logic low. <BR><BR>In view of the 
many possible embodiments to which the principles or invention may be applied, 
it should be recognized that the illustrated embodiments are only an example in 
accordance with the invention and should not be taken as a limitation on the 
scope of the invention. Rather, the invention is defined by the following 
claims. We therefore claim as the invention all such embodiments that come 
within the scope of these claims. <BR><BR>
