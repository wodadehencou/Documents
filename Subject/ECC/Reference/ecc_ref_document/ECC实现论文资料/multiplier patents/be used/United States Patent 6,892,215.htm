<CENTER><B>Abstract</B></CENTER>
<P>A fast, parallel modular multiplier is presented which is scalable according 
to available hardware resources. Linear throughput increases with respect to 
consumed resources is achieved. Multiple independent data streams may be 
processed simultaneously, and optimal clock rates are attained by virtue of 
limited fan-out of all signal paths and nearest neighbor interconnections. 
Integrated circuit implementation is benefited by the potential for signal 
sharing among input and output busses and a common control interface for all 
independent data streams. </P>

<BR><BR>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS <BR><BR>Not applicable. 
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <BR><BR>1. Field of the Invention 
<BR><BR>The present invention relates to the processing of digital signals to 
render modular multiplication. <BR><BR>2. Description of Related Art 
<BR><BR>Modular multiplication, which is the computation of A¡¤B modulo M where 
A, B, and M are integer values, is a fundamental mathematical operation in 
applications based on number-theoretic arithmetic. A central application area is 
cryptography, where techniques such as the popular RSA and DSS methods utilize 
modular multiplication as the elemental computation. Since large word lengths on 
the order of thousands of bits are typically processed, hardware approaches to 
modular multiplication are typically very slow. Existing art attempts to address 
this deficiency through a handful of approaches. <BR><BR>Linear systolic array 
approaches dominate the art, with the article C. Walter, "Systolic modular 
multiplication," IEEE Transactions on Computers, v. 42, no. 3, pp. 376-378, 
1993, being representative. In such an approach, a linear array of processing 
elements is connected so that all signal paths are formed between adjoining 
elements only. Thus, signal path lengths are minimized. Accordingly, all signal 
paths only connect two adjoining elements, guaranteeing unit fan out. The 
forgoing properties of systolic arrays ensure that the clock rate is determined 
solely by the processing element delay. However, efforts to scale the 
performance beyond the level offered by a single linear array have encountered 
very limited success. Cell optimization is the commonly applied technique to 
gain performance. However, performance scales only logarithmically with respect 
to consumed integrated circuit area. <BR><BR>Another method which attempts to 
provide a performance-area tradeoff is the digit-serial array. In the paper, J. 
Guo and C. Wang, "A novel digit-serial systolic array for modular 
multiplication," in Proc. of the 1998 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits 
and Systems, v. 2, pp. 177-180, 1998, a digit-serial modular multiplier 
methodology was presented. However, the arrays were not pipelined, and thus the 
clock period of the digit-serial cells grows proportionally with digit size. 
Therefore, performance scaling occurs in a sub-linear fashion for small digit 
sizes and quickly saturates to yield negligible performance gains for large 
digit sizes. <BR><BR>A non-systolic array was presented in the article H. Orup, 
"Simplifying quotient digit determination in high-radix modular multiplication," 
in Proc. of the 12th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic, pp. 193-199, 1995. A 
roughly linear performance-area tradeoff was achieved through retiming of the 
modular correction loop within the modular multiplication algorithm. However, 
the clock rate is severely limited by the required full-word-length signal 
broadcasts of the modular correction selection bit. Thus, the fan out of the 
aforementioned signal is the complete word length. Implementational efforts to 
increase the signal drive through transistor sizing destroys the linear 
performance-area trade off and only provide minor mitigation of the 
slow-clock-rate obstacle plaguing this methodology. <BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE 
INVENTION <BR><BR>The present invention describes a method for parallel modular 
multiplication capable of processing multiple independent data streams 
simultaneously. <BR><BR>An implementation realizing this method consists of a 
cascade of full-word-length linear arrays of processing elements which each 
accept and generate bit-level data. Each processing element performs bit-wise 
partial product formation, modular correction formation, and summation of the 
generated partial product and modular correction bits with the 
right-single-bit-shifted result of the previous algorithmic iteration. The 
number of rows of the array cascade is determined in accordance with the 
available integrated circuit implementation area and the desired throughput 
performance, which scales linearly with row count. Data propagates in a 
feed-forward manner from row to row upon completion of the segment of iterations 
assigned to each row. <BR><BR>The data stream capacity and operational 
throughput are directly scalable with the available integrated circuit 
implementation area. This performance scalability is accomplished while 
maintaining a systolic paradigm, such that all interconnection paths are locally 
connected to neighboring processing elements and entail minimal fan out. Thus, 
the achievable clock rate is maximized and is dictated by the processing element 
delay rather than by long interconnect paths or loading due to multiple-gate fan 
out. Moreover, in contrast to isolated parallel modular multiplication arrays, 
the unified array structure of the present invention incorporates single input 
and output data buses, thereby reducing global integrated circuit wiring 
overhead. Additionally, the unified array permits a single controller to be 
utilized when the modular multiplier is utilized as a component in a 
higher-level functional unit such as a modular exponentiator. <BR><BR>OBJECTS 
AND ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION <BR><BR>The primary object of this invention is 
fast parallel processing of modular multiplication. <BR><BR>It is an advantage 
of this invention that multiple independent data streams may be simultaneously 
processed. The number of data streams is arbitrary, limited only by 
implementation area. <BR><BR>It is a primary advantage of this method that 
throughput performance scales linearly with the area of the integrated circuit 
implementation while maintaining the optimal systolic clock rate. The latter is 
attained through guaranteeing properties of purely nearest neighbor 
interconnections between processing elements and unit signal fan out. <BR><BR>It 
is an advantage of this invention that input and output data share signal lines 
such that the number of internal signal buses in an integrated circuit 
implementation are reduced. <BR><BR>It is an advantage of this invention that a 
unified control unit may be utilized when the modular multiplier unit is used in 
a modular exponentiator. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <BR><BR>FIG.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS <BR><BR>The preferred embodiment is 
delineated in FIG. <B>1</B>. It consists of a cascade of K linear systolic 
arrays of bit-wise processing cells, where K is chosen according to the amount 
of integrated circuit area available for the implementation. The value of K 
directly relates to the amount of parallelism implemented in the system. Each 
array is composed of N+1 cells, where N represents the word length of the 
modulus value in bits. <BR><BR>Each cell possesses a set of bit-wise inputs 
corresponding to the multiplicand, multiplier, modular correction, modular 
selection, partial sum, and two previous carry signals. Each cell also possesses 
a set of bit-wise outputs corresponding to the multiplicand, multiplier, modular 
correction, modular selection, generated partial sum, and two generated carry 
signals. Each inner cell <B>1</B> excluding the leftmost and rightmost 
peripheral cells in each array and all cells in the bottommost array, is 
interconnected within the structure in the following manner. The multiplicand 
output is delivered to input PRI of a multiplexed dual-delay element, whose 
output is connected to the multiplicand input of the cell under consideration. 
The multiplicand output also connects to the input SEC of a multiplexed 
dual-delay element whose output connects to the corresponding cell in the 
below-adjacent array. The multiplier output delayed by one cycle is connected to 
the left-adjacent cell's multiplier input. The modular correction output 
connects to input PRI of a multiplexed dual-delay element, whose output is 
connected to the modular correction input of the cell under consideration. The 
modular correction output also connects to the SEC input of a multiplexed 
dual-delay element, whose output connects to the modular correction input of the 
corresponding cell in the below-adjacent array. The modular selection output 
delayed by one cycle is connected to the left-adjacent cell's modular selection 
input. The generated partial sum output is connected to the PRI input of a 
multiplexed delay element whose output connects to the right-adjacent cell's 
partial sum input. The generated partial sum output also connects to the SEC 
input of a multiplexed delay element whose output connects to the partial sum 
input of the right-adjacent cell in the below-adjacent array. Finally, each of 
the two carry outputs delayed by one cycle is connected to the corresponding 
carry inputs of the left-adjacent cell. <BR><BR>Rightmost, least-significant 
cell <B>2</B> connections for the multiplicand and modular correction outputs 
are identical to the above description for the inner cells. However, the partial 
sum output connections differ. The partial sum output is connected to the PRI 
input of a multiplexed dual-delay element whose output is connected to the 
modular selection input. The partial sum output is also connected to the SEC 
input of a multiplexed dual-delay element associated with the below-adjacent 
array, whose output connects to the modular selection input of the corresponding 
cell. The multiplier input of a rightmost cell is supplied externally in the 
form of a serial, least-significant-bit first stream. Both carry inputs are 
connected to ground. <BR><BR>Leftmost, most-significant <B>3</B> cell 
connections for the multiplicand, modular correction, and partial sum outputs 
are identical to the inner cell description. The single carry output is 
connected to the PRI input of a multiplexed dual-delay element, whose output is 
connected to the partial sum input. The single carry output is also connected to 
the SEC input of a multiplexed dual-delay element, whose output is connected to 
the partial sum input of the corresponding cell in the below-adjacent array. 
<BR><BR>In the bottommost array <B>4</B>, modular selection and multiplier 
outputs are connected identically to the aforementioned inner cell description. 
The modular correction output is connected to the PRI input of a multiplexed 
dual-delay element, whose output is connected to the modular correction input. 
The multiplicand output is connected to the PRI input of a multiplexed 
dual-delay element, whose output is connected to the multiplicand input. The 
partial sum output is connected to the PRI input of a multiplexed delay element, 
whose output is connected to the partial sum input of the right-adjacent cell. 
<BR><BR>Each cell performs a computation which, for the purposes of 
illustration, may be decomposed into the following sequence of bit-wise 
operations. The multiplicand input bit is ANDed with the multiplier input bit. 
Similarly, the modular correction input bit is ANDed with the modular selection 
input bit. The outputs of the two aforementioned computations are added with the 
partial sum input and the two carry inputs. The least significant bit of the 
latter sum is connected to the cell's partial sum output, while the two bits 
generated in the most significant position are connected to the two carry 
outputs. The multiplicand, modular correction, multiplier, and modular selection 
inputs are also passed to the multiplicand, modular correction, multiplier, and 
modular selection outputs, respectively. Within each rightmost cell, all aspects 
of the above description remain valid except that only a single bit in the most 
significant position is generated. Thus, each rightmost cell possesses a single 
carry output. <BR><BR>A delay element <B>9</B> receives a single input and 
delays the signal presented in the current clock cycle until the subsequent 
clock cycle, and presents the delayed single to the output. <BR><BR>The 
multiplexed dual-delay element <B>5</B> takes in two data inputs, labeled PRI 
and SEC. An additional input SEL is used to multiplex data at the PRI and SEC 
inputs to the input of a delay register. De-assertion of the SEL input selects 
the PRI input, while assertion selects the SEC input. The output of the delay 
register is connected to another delay register, whose output is identically the 
output of the multiplexed dual-delay element. <BR><BR>Similarly, the multiplexed 
delay element <B>6</B> takes in two data inputs, labeled PRI and SEC. An 
additional input SEL is used to multiplex data at the PRI and SEC inputs to the 
input of a delay register. De-assertion of the SEL input selects the PRI input, 
while assertion selects the SEC input. The output of the delay register 
constitutes the output of the multiplexed delay element. <BR><BR>A counter 
<B>7</B> asserts the signal PASS_DATA <B>8</B> for two clock cycles every 
[(N+2)/K] clock cycles, where [ARGUMENT] denotes the next highest integer when 
the ARGUMENT is not an integer, otherwise [ARGUMENT]=ARGUMENT. The signal 
PASS_DATA is connected to the SEL input of each multiplexed delay element 
associated with each rightmost cell. De-assertion of the PASS_DATA signal 
selects the PRI input to the multiplexed delay element, whereas assertion 
selects the SEC input. Within each linear array, the PASS_DATA signal is also 
connected to a delay element associated with the rightmost cell, whose output 
connects to a corresponding delay element associated with the left-adjacent 
cell. Likewise, each inner cell accepts the PASS_DATA signal from the delay 
associated with the right-adjacent cell and outputs the signal to a delay 
element associated with the left-adjacent cell. <BR><BR>Initial data is supplied 
externally to the unit such that two new independent data sets commence 
processing every [(N+2)/K] clock cycles, coincident with the assertion of the 
PASS_DATA signal. Multiplicand and modular correction data bits are entered into 
the topmost array in the following manner. The rightmost cell receives the 
modular correction, multiplicand and multiplier bits associated with the first 
of the two currently entering data streams upon the first clock cycle wherein 
PASS_DATA is asserted. Upon the next clock cycle, the modular correction 
multiplicand and multiplier bits associated with the second of two currently 
entering data streams are received. In subsequent cycles, the rightmost cell 
receives the next most significant multiplier bit associated with the first data 
stream if the clock cycle number is even, and with the second stream if the 
clock cycle number is odd. Multiplicand and modular correction bits are no 
longer externally entered into the array in the rightmost cell position until 
the next assertion of the PASS_DATA signal, at which point two new data streams 
are commenced. An arbitrary cell in column J of the topmost array externally 
receives the corresponding modular correction and multiplicand bits associated 
with the first data stream J clock cycles after PASS_DATA is asserted. Modular 
correction and multiplicand bits associated with the second data stream are 
received J+1 cycles after the assertion of the PASS_DATA signal. The leftmost 
cell of the topmost array receives the corresponding multiplicand bit associated 
with the first data stream N cycles after the assertion of PASS_DATA. Similarly, 
the leftmost cell receives the multiplicand bit associated with the second 
stream N+1 cycles after the assertion of PASS_DATA. The modular correction input 
associated with the leftmost cell of the topmost array is grounded. <BR><BR>An 
illustration of the modular multiplier array cascade for the K=4, N=5 case is 
shown in FIG. <B>1</B>. Arrays for other parameterizations should be evident to 
an individual in the field with a grasp of the above description. <BR><BR>
