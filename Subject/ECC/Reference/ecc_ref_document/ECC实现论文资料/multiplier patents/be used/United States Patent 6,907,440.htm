<FONT size=+1>Systolic cylindrical array modular multiplier </FONT><BR><BR>
<CENTER><B>Abstract</B></CENTER>
<P>A fast, scalable, systolic modular multiplier is presented. Linear throughput 
scalability with respect to consumed hardware resources is achieved through 
simultaneous parallel processing of multiple independent data streams. Optimal 
clock rates are attained by virtue of systolic properties of limited fan-out of 
all signal paths and nearest neighbor interconnections. Signal sharing among 
input and output busses and a common control interface for all independent data 
streams is made possible, thus benefiting integrated circuit implementations.

<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <BR><BR>1. Field of the Invention 
<BR><BR>The present invention relates to the processing of digital signals to 
render modular multiplication. <BR><BR>2. Description of Related Art 
<BR><BR>Modular multiplication, which is the computation of A-B modulo M where 
A, B, and M are integer values, is a fundamental mathematical operation in 
applications based on number-theoretic arithmetic. A central application area is 
cryptography, where techniques such as the popular RSA and DSS methods utilize 
modular multiplication as the elemental computation. Since large word lengths on 
the order of thousands of bits are typically processed, hardware approaches to 
modular multiplication are typically very slow. Existing art attempts to address 
this deficiency through a handful of approaches. <BR><BR>Linear systolic array 
approaches dominate the art, with the article C. Walter, "Systolic modular 
multiplication," IEEE Transactions on Computers, v. 42, no. 3, pp. 376-378, 
1993, being representative. In such an approach, a linear array of processing 
elements is connected so that all signal paths are formed between adjoining 
elements only. Thus, signal path lengths are minimized. Accordingly, all signal 
paths only connect two adjoining elements, guaranteeing unit fan out. The 
forgoing properties of systolic arrays ensure that the clock rate is determined 
solely by the processing element delay. However, efforts to scale the 
performance beyond the level offered by a single linear array have encountered 
very limited success. Cell optimization is the commonly applied technique to 
gain performance. However, performance scales only logarithmically with respect 
to consumed integrated circuit area. <BR><BR>Another method which attempts to 
provide a performance-area tradeoff is the digit-serial array. In the paper, J. 
Guo and C. Wang, "A novel digit-serial systolic array for modular 
multiplication," in Proc. of the 1998 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits 
and Systems, v. 2, pp. 177-180, 1998, a digit-serial modular multiplier 
methodology was presented. However, the arrays were not pipelined, and thus the 
clock period of the digit-serial cells grows proportionally with digit size. 
Therefore, performance scaling occurs in a sub-linear fashion for small digit 
sizes and quickly saturates to yield negligible performance gains for large 
digit sizes. <BR><BR>A non-systolic array was presented in the article H. Orup, 
"Simplifying quotient digit determination in high-radix modular multiplication," 
in Proc. of the 12th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic, pp. 193-199, 1995. A 
roughly linear performance-area tradeoff was achieved through retiming of the 
modular correction loop within the modular multiplication algorithm. However, 
the clock rate is severely limited by the required fill-word-length signal 
broadcasts of the modular correction selection bit. Thus, the fan out of the 
aforementioned signal is the complete word length. Implementational efforts to 
increase the signal drive through transistor sizing destroys the linear 
performance-area trade off and only provide minor mitigation of the 
slow-clock-rate obstacle plaguing this methodology. <BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE 
INVENTION <BR><BR>The present invention describes a method for parallel modular 
multiplication capable of processing multiple independent data streams 
simultaneously. <BR><BR>An implementation realizing this method consists of a 
multi-row array of processing elements having a column count equivalent to the 
modular multiplication word length. Each processing element accepts and 
generates bit-level data and performs partial product formation, modular 
correction formation, and summation of these generated bits with the 
right-single-bit-shifted result of the previous algorithmic iteration. The 
number of rows of the array is determined in accordance with the available 
integrated circuit implementation area and the desired throughput performance, 
which scales linearly with row count. <BR><BR>The data stream capacity and 
operational throughput are directly scalable with the available integrated 
circuit implementation area. This performance scalability is accomplished while 
maintaining a systolic paradigm, such that all interconnection paths are locally 
connected to neighboring processing elements and entail minimal fan out. Thus, 
the achievable clock rate is maximized and is dictated by the processing element 
delay rather than by long interconnect paths or loading due to multiple-gate fan 
out. Moreover, in contrast to isolated parallel modular multiplication arrays, 
the unified array structure of the present invention incorporates single input 
and output data buses, thereby reducing global integrated circuit wiring 
overhead. Additionally, the unified array permits a single controller to be 
utilized when the modular multiplier is utilized as a component in a 
higher-level functional unit such as a modular exponentiator. <BR><BR>Objects 
and Advantages of the Invention <BR><BR>The primary object of this invention is 
fast parallel processing of modular multiplication. <BR><BR>It is an advantage 
of this invention that multiple independent data streams may be simultaneously 
processed. The number of data streams is arbitrary, limited only by 
implementation area. <BR><BR>It is a primary advantage of this method that 
throughput performance scales linearly with the area of the integrated circuit 
implementation while maintaining the optimal systolic clock rate. The latter is 
attained through guaranteeing properties of purely nearest neighbor 
interconnections between processing elements and unit signal fan out. <BR><BR>It 
is an advantage of this invention that input and output data share signal lines 
such that the number of internal signal buses in an integrated circuit 
implementation are reduced. <BR><BR>It is an advantage of this invention that a 
unified control unit may be utilized when the modular multiplier unit is used in 
a modular exponentiator. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <BR><BR>FIG.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS <BR><BR>The preferred embodiment is an 
array consisting of K rows and N+1 columns of bit-wise processing cells, where N 
represents the word length of the modulus value in bits and K is an integer 
parameter with value greater than one chosen according to the amount of 
integrated circuit area available for the implementation. The value of K 
directly relates to the amount of parallelism implemented in the array. 
<BR><BR>Each cell possesses a set of bit-wise inputs corresponding to the 
multiplicand, multiplier, modular correction, modular selection, partial sum, 
and two previous carry signals. Each cell also possesses a set of bit-wise 
outputs corresponding to the multiplicand, multiplier, modular correction, 
modular selection, generated partial sum, and two generated carry signals. Each 
inner cell <B>1</B>, excluding the leftmost, rightmost, and bottommost 
peripheral cells, is interconnected within the structure in the following 
manner: the multiplicand output delayed by two cycles is connected to the 
multiplicand input of the below-adjacent cell. The multiplier output delayed by 
one cycle is connected to the left-adjacent cell's multiplier input. The modular 
correction output delayed by two cycles connects to the modular correction input 
of the below-adjacent cell. The modular selection output delayed by one cycle is 
connected to the left-adjacent cell's modular selection input. The generated 
partial sum output delayed by one cycle is connected to the below-right-adjacent 
cell's partial sum input. Finally, each of the two carry outputs delayed by one 
cycle is connected to the corresponding carry inputs of the left-adjacent cell. 
<BR><BR>Rightmost, least-significant cell <B>2</B> connections for the 
multiplicand and modular correction outputs are identical to the above 
description for the inner cells. However, the partial sum output connections 
differ. The partial sum output is connected to the modular selection input of 
the below-adjacent cell. The multiplier input of each rightmost cell is supplied 
externally in the form of a serial, lesser-significance-to-greater-significance 
stream. Both carry inputs are connected to ground. <BR><BR>Leftmost, 
most-significant cell <B>3</B> connections for the multiplicand, modular 
correction, and partial sum outputs are identical to the inner cell description. 
The single carry output is connected to the partial sum input of the 
below-adjacent cell. <BR><BR>In the bottommost row <B>4</B>, modular selection 
and multiplier outputs are connected identically to the aforementioned inner 
cell description. The modular correction output is delayed by H+2 clock cycles 
and is recirculated to the PRI input of the multiplexed delay element in the 
topmost row, whose output is connected to the modular correction input of the 
topmost cell residing in the same column. The SEC input of the same multiplexed 
delay input is connected externally for provision of initial modular correction 
data. H is a fixed parameter for the entire array structure and is chosen to be 
an integer value such that 1¨QH¨QK-2 The multiplicand output is delayed by H+2 
clock cycles and is recirculated to the PRI input of the multiplexed delay 
element in the topmost row, whose output is connected to the multiplicand input 
of the topmost cell residing in the same column. The SEC input of the same 
multiplexed delay input is connected externally for provision of initial 
multiplicand data. The partial sum output delayed by H+1 delays is recirculated 
to the multiplexed delay element associated with the right-adjacent cell in the 
topmost array, whose output is connected to the partial sum input of the same 
cell. The partial sum output is also provided externally at the bottommost row 
as the overall array output. Note that the recirculated modular correction, 
multiplicand, and partial sum signals may be physically routed through the 
intervening cells of the array, with the H or H-1 delays being distributed as 
evenly as possible among the cell interconnections involved. While this 
description is operationally equivalent to the former description in terms of 
processing behavior, it assists in increasing the achievable clock rate in the 
physical integrated circuit. For instance, when H=K-2 is chosen, the partial sum 
output of a cell in the bottom row is delayed by one cycle and routed to a 
pass-through input in the above-right-adjacent cell. The signal is then output 
and delayed by one clock cycle and is connected to the above-adjacent cell. The 
latter process is repeated until the topmost cell is reached. Therefore, one 
delay element exists prior to each inter-cell excursion within the array, thus 
guaranteeing minimal interconnect lengths and maximum clock rate. In the same 
way, the modular correction and multiplicand signal outputs of the cell in the 
bottommost row are recirculated such that at least one delay element exists 
prior to each inter-cell excursion. <BR><BR>Each cell performs a computation 
which, for the purposes of illustration, may be decomposed into the following 
sequence of bit-wise operations. The multiplicand input bit is ANDed with the 
multiplier input bit. Similarly, the modular correction input bit is ANDed with 
the modular selection input bit. The outputs of the two aforementioned 
computations are added with the partial sum input and the two carry inputs. The 
least significant bit of the latter sum is connected to the cell's partial sum 
output, while the two bits generated in the most significant position are 
connected to the two carry outputs. The multiplicand, modular correction, 
multiplier, and modular selection inputs are also passed to the multiplicand, 
modular correction, multiplier, and modular selection outputs, respectively. 
Within each rightmost cell, all aspects of the above description remain valid 
except that only a single bit in the most significant position is generated. 
Thus, each rightmost cell possesses a single carry output. <BR><BR>Delay 
elements <B>6</B>, have one input, and delay the input signal by a specified 
number of clock cycles before presenting the resultant signal at the single 
output. <BR><BR>The multiplexed delay element <B>5</B> takes in two data inputs, 
labeled PRI and SEC. An additional input SEL is used to multiplex data at the 
PRI and SEC inputs to the input of a delay register. De-assertion of the SEL 
input selects the PRI input, while assertion selects the SEC input. The output 
of the delay register constitutes the output of the multiplexed delay element. 
<BR><BR>A counter <B>7</B> asserts the signal PASS_DATA <B>8</B> for 2K+H clock 
cycles every (2K+H)*[(N+2)/K] clock cycles, where [ARGUMENT] denotes the next 
highest integer when the ARGUMENT is not an integer, otherwise 
[ARGUMENT]=ARGUMENT. The signal PASS_DATA is connected to the SEL input of the 
multiplexed delay element associated with the rightmost cell in the topmost row. 
De-assertion of the PASS_DATA signal selects the PRI input to the multiplexed 
delay element, whereas assertion selects the SEC input. The PASS_DATA signal is 
delayed by one clock cycle and passed to the left-adjacent cell where it is 
input to the SEL input of the associated multiplexed delay element. Once again, 
the signal is also again delayed by one clock cycle and passed to the 
left-adjacent cell. This procedure is repeated until the leftmost cell is 
reached. <BR><BR>Initial data is supplied externally to the unit such that 2K+H 
new independent data sets commence processing in sequence every (2K+H)*[(N+2)/K] 
clock cycles. Multiplicand and modular correction data bits are entered into the 
cells of the topmost row in the following manner. The rightmost cell receives 
the least significant modular correction, multiplicand and multiplier bits 
associated with the first of the 2K+H data streams upon the first clock cycle 
wherein PASS_DATA is asserted. Upon the next clock cycle, the least significant 
modular correction, multiplicand and multiplier bits associated with the second 
of 2K+H currently entering data streams are received. In each of the subsequent 
2K+H-2 cycles, the rightmost cell successively receives the remaining 2K+H-2 
least significant bits of each input type. An identical process commences for 
the next-to-least significant modular correction and multiplicand inputs in the 
left-adjacent cell in the second clock cycle wherein PASS_DATA is asserted. 
Similarly, the delivery of the first of 2K+H bits corresponding to column J 
significance is provided J cycles after the initial assertion of PASS_DATA. 
After 2K+H bits have been successively received by the first cell of each 
column, no more modular correction or multiplicand initial data is taken in 
until the next assertion of PASS_DATA renew the above procedure. As mentioned 
above, the rightmost cell of the topmost row begins successively accepting the 
least significant bits of the multiplier input data upon the assertion of 
PASS_DATA. After 2K+H clock cycles. the bit position K of the multiplier input 
data begins to arrive and is received for the remaining data streams for the 
next 2K+H cycles. In general, for a rightmost cell in row R where 0¨QR¨QK-1, clock 
cycle C*(2K+H)+2R marks the beginning of the multiplier input bit position C*K+R 
where C is an arbitrary integer such that 0¨QC¨Q[(N+1)/K]. <BR><BR>An illustration 
of the modular multiplier array for the K=3, H=1, N=3 case is shown in FIG. 
<B>1</B>. Arrays for other parameterizations should be evident to an individual 
in the field with a grasp of the above description. <BR><BR>
