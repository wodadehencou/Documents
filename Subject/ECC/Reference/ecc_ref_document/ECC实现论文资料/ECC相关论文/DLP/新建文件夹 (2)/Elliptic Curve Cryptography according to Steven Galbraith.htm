size=+1>Summary</FONT></FONT></FONT></B> 
<P>Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) was proposed by Victor Miller and Neal 
Koblitz in the mid 1980s. 
<P>An <B>elliptic curve</B> is the set of solutions (x,y) to an equation of the 
form y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B, together with an extra point O which is called the 
<B>point at infinity</B>. For applications to cryptography we consider <B>finite 
fields</B> of q elements, which I will write as F_q or GF( q ). When q is a 
prime one can think of F_q as the integers modulo q. 
<P>We usually write E for the equation y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B and use the notation 
E( F_q ) for the set of points (x,y) with coordinates in the field F_q together 
with the point O (which is defined over every field). 
<P>The set of points on an elliptic curve forms a <B>group</B> under a certain 
addition rule, which we write using the notation +. The point O is the identity 
element of the group. When we work over a finite field then this group is 
necessarily finite (as there are only finitely many points). 
<P>Given a point P=(x,y) and a positive integer n we define [n]P = P + P + ... + 
P (n times). The <B>order</B> of a point P=(x,y) is the smallest positive 
integer n such that [n]P = O. 
<P>We denote by &lt; P &gt; the <B>group generated by P</B>. In other words &lt; 
P &gt; = {O, P, P+P, P+P+P, . . .}. 
<P>The security of elliptic curve cryptography relies on the following problem: 
<P><B><FONT size=4>Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP):</FONT></B> 
Let E be an elliptic curve over a finite field F_q. Suppose P is some point of 
E( F_q ) and let Q be a point in &lt; P &gt;. Find an integer t such that Q = 
[t] P. 
<P>It is widely believed that the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem is 
hard to computationally solve when the point P has large prime order. The known 
methods for solving the ECDLP are: 
<UL>
  <LI>The Pohlig-Hellman algorithm (which reduces the problem to subgroups of 
  prime order). 
  <LI>Shanks' baby-step-giant-step method. 
  <LI>Pollard's methods (especially the parallel Pollard method of van Oorschot 
  and Wiener). 
  <LI>The Menezes-Okamoto-Vanstone (MOV) attack using the Weil pairing. 
  <LI>The Frey-Rueck attack using the Tate pairing. 
  <LI>The attacks on anomalous elliptic curves (i.e., elliptic curves over F_p 
  which have p points) due to Semaev, Satoh-Araki and Smart. 
  <LI>Weil descent (for some special finite fields). </LI></UL>Of the above 
methods, only the anomalous curves attack runs in polynomial time. The MOV, 
Frey-Rueck and Weil descent methods are (at their fastest) subexponential in 
complexity. 
<P>Due to the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm we <B>always</B> restrict to the case 
where the point P has <B>large prime order</B>. Then the only algorithms which 
are applicable for all elliptic curves are the methods of Shanks and Pollard, 
and these methods have exponential complexity. 
<P>The public key cryptosystems available for ECC are analogues of the 
cryptosystems available for other discrete logarithm based systems (such as the 
multiplicative group of a finite field). These include Diffie-Hellman key 
exchange, El Gamal public key encryption, and ECDSA (an analogue of the US 
government's digital signature standard). 
<P>In fact, the security of cryptosystems based on elliptic curves usually 
relies on related problems like the (computational) Diffie-Hellman problem (CDH) 
or the Decision Diffie-Hellman problem (DDH).

<P>The best way to get the news about ECC is to attend the annual ECC 
conference. The <A 
href="http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/conferences/2004/ecc2004/announcement.html">next 
ECC conference</A> will be held on September 20-22 in Bochum, Germany. 
<P>The big news (in my opinion) in ECC over the past few years has been in the 
following areas: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI><B><FONT color=#000080><FONT face=Arial,Arial><FONT size=+1>Point 
  counting</FONT></FONT></FONT></B> 
  <P>The development of p-adic point counting algorithms was initiated by <A 
  href="http://www.rimath.saitama-u.ac.jp/lab.en/TkkzSatoh/">Takakazu Satoh</A>. 
  Further results have been found by <A

  Gaudry</A>, <A href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~harley/">Robert Harley</A>,

    Harley's post to NMBRTHRY</A> </LI></UL>
  <P>The outcome of this research is that counting points on elliptic curves 
  (and various curves of genus more than one) over fields of small 
  characteristic two) is now extremely efficient. From a cryptographic point of 
  view this means that parameter generation is very fast for elliptic curves in 
  characteristic two. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B><FONT color=#000080><FONT face=Arial,Arial><FONT size=+1>Weil 
  descent</FONT></FONT></FONT></B> 
  <P>The application of Weil restriction of scalars to the ECDLP was first 
  proposed by <A 
  href="http://www.exp-math.uni-essen.de/zahlentheorie/people/frey.html">Professor 
  Gerhard Frey</A>. This work has been further developed by Galbraith, <A 
  href="http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~nigel/">Nigel Smart</A>, Pierrick Gaudry, <A 
  href="http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~florian/">Florian Hess</A>, Claus Diem, <A 
  href="http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/~ajmeneze/">Alfred Menezes</A>, 
  Minghua Qu, Jacobson, Stein, Teske, Maurer etc etc. 
  <P>As a method to attack the ECDLP it has had very limited success. The 
  complexity is usually exponential (although in some very special cases the 
  complexity is subexponential). Nevertheless, it has revealed that some special 
  curves over some special fields (such as GF( 2^155 ) and GF( 2^210 )) are 
  weaker than had been originally thought. 
  <P>Weil descent attacks have had very little effect on most applications of 
  ECC since the fields used in practice are either GF( p ) or GF( 2^n ) where n 
  is a prime. 
  <P>Here are the slides from my <A 
  href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~sdg/gw.ps">survey of Weil descent</A> talks 
  in Grenoble. More details and references may be found at <A

  descent page</A>.

  <LI><B><FONT color=#000080><FONT face=Arial,Arial><FONT size=+1>Weil pairing 
  and Tate pairing</FONT></FONT></FONT></B> 
  <P>The use of the Weil pairing and Tate pairing in cryptography goes back to 
  Victor Miller's unpublished paper of 1986, and in particular the results of 
  Menezes-Okamoto-Vanstone and Frey-Rueck. However, these first applications 
  were destructive (i.e., using pairings to transform the ECDLP into a discrete 
  logarithm problem in the multiplicative group of a finite field). 
  <P>More recently it has been noticed that pairings can be used to build 
  cryptosystems with certain functionality. The foundational paper is Antoine 
  Joux ``A one-round protocol for tripartite Diffie-Hellman''. In fact, earlier 
  work suggesting the use of pairings in cryptography was done by 
  Mitsunari-Sakai-Kasahara in 1999 and Sakai-Oghishi-Kasahara in 2000. In 
  particular, the paper of Sakai-Oghishi-Kasahara suggests that pairings could 
  be used to enable identity-based cryptography. However, these two Japanese 
  papers were not known to the `western' academic community until 2002. 
  <P>The most impressive application of pairings to cryptography is the <A 
  href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/ibe/">identity-based encryption scheme</A> of 
  Boneh and Franklin (Crypto 2001). This system elegantly solves the 
  long-standing open problem of providing secure and efficient identity-based 
  encryption (Shamir had already given identity-based signatures in his 1984 
  paper which invented the principle). A generalisation of this concept is 
  identifier-based cryptography. <!-- <a href="http://www.cesg.gov.uk/technology/id-pkc/index.htm">identifier-based
cryptography</a>. -->
  <P>Note that, in implementations, the Tate pairing is superior to the Weil 
  pairing. For details on this see Galbraith-Harrison-Soldera <A 
  href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2002/HPL-2002-23.html">Implementing 
  the Tate pairing</A> (ANTS-V) or Barreto-Kim-Lynn-Scott ``Efficient algorithms 
  for pairing-based cryptosystems'' (CRYPTO 2002). 
  <P>Pairings are currently the most active research area in ECC. Some people 
  working in this area include Eric Verheul, Antoine Joux, Kim Nguyen, <A 
  href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/">Dan Boneh</A>, <A 
  href="http://rooster.stanford.edu/~ben/">Ben Lynn</A>, Hovav Shacham,

  <LI><B><FONT color=#000080><FONT face=Arial,Arial><FONT size=+1>Provable 
  security</FONT></FONT></FONT></B> 
  <P>One of the main new concepts in cryptography is the idea of <B>proving 
  security</B> of cryptographic protocols. The basic idea is this: we suppose 
  there is some kind of adversary (an algorithm) which is capable of breaking 
  our cryptosystem. We then give a method to transform this adversary into 
  another algorithm which can solve the underlying mathematical problem (e.g., 
  the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman problem or whatever). Hence, if the 
  underlying mathematical problem is genuinely hard then the adversary cannot 
  exist (this is proof by contradiction). 
  <P>The case of ECC is usually handled by the same methods as used for other 
  schemes. However, one technique which is sometimes used is to model an 
  elliptic curve as a `generic group'. Whether the <B>generic group model</B> is 
  meaningul in practice is a topic of debate. Some people working in this area 
  include Dan Brown, Nigel Smart, John Malone-Lee, David Pointcheval, Jaques 
  Stern, Tatsuaki Okamoto etc etc.

<P>There are now several excellent books about ECC. 
<P><A

Course in Number Theory and Cryptography</A> by Neal Koblitz. This is the best 
``easy'' reference for ECC. It contains a nice presentation of the basic ideas. 
Unfortunately, the book is too elementary to cover many topics which are needed 
to understand the research literature in ECC.<BR><B>This book is highly 
recommended for beginners</B>. 
<P><A href="http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/ecc/">Guide to Elliptic Curve 
Cryptography</A> by Darrel Hankerson, Alfred Menezes, and Scott Vanstone. This 
book is written for computer scientists, engineers and security professionals. 
It gives a very thorough and detailed presentation of the implementation aspects 
of ECC. Many efficient algorithms for point multiplication etc are described. 
The book does not deeply discuss the mathematics behind ECC.<BR><B>This book is 
highly recommended for cryptographers who want to implement or use ECC in 
practice</B>. 
<P><A href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/info_theory/ellipbook.html">Elliptic 
Curves and Cryptography</A> by Ian Blake, Gadiel Seroussi and Nigel Smart. This 
book is useful resource for those readers who have already understood the basic 
ideas of elliptic curve cryptography. This book discusses many important 
implementation details, for instance finite field arithmetic and efficient 
methods for elliptic curve operations. The book also gives a partial description 
of the Schoof-Atkin-Elkies point counting algorithm (mainly in characteristic 
two) and a description of some of the mathematics behind the attacks on the 
ECDLP.<BR><B>This book is recommended for researchers in the field</B>. 
<P>
<P><A href="http://www.math.umd.edu/~lcw/ec.html">Elliptic Curves: Number Theory 
and Cryptography</A> by Lawrence C. Washington. This is a very nice book about 
the mathematics of elliptic curves. It contains proofs of many of the main 
theorems needed to understand elliptic curves, but at a slightly more elementary 
level than, say, Silverman's book. This book would be an excellent next step 
after the book of Koblitz mentioned above. There is quite a lot of information 
about cryptographic aspects, including a discussion of the Weil and Tate 
pairings.<BR><B>This book is recommended for those who want to get a deeper 
understanding of the mathematics behind ECC</B>.
